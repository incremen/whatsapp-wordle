# Botanar

A WhatsApp bot with multiple modules — Wordle, Last.fm, and LaTeX. Built with `whatsapp-web.js` and runs as your WhatsApp user. Works in DMs and group chats.

This is inspired by discord bots, who have a lot of functionality. The goal is to import all the cool stuff discord bots can do into whatsapp.
- `!help` — list all commands

## Wordle

Play Wordle in any chat. Supports shared games in group chats, hints, daily challenges, survival mode, and stats tracking.

## Run locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Google Chrome or Chromium installed

### Setup
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Check `src/clientConfig.ts` — if Chrome/Chromium isn't in the default path, update `executablePath`.

3. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Scan the QR code that appears in your terminal with WhatsApp (Linked Devices > Link a Device).

The bot runs as your WhatsApp user — messages you send with `!wordle`, `!fm`, `!l`, etc. will work in any chat.

> By default, `npm run dev` runs in `LOCAL_ONLY` mode (only LaTeX commands active). Remove `LOCAL_ONLY=true` from `nodemon.json` to enable all commands locally.

> `docs/how_vps.md` has instructions for running on a VPS with PM2.
